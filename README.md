# Awurudu Game - Aliyata Aha Thabeema

### What is Aliyata Aha Thabeema?
* A game that's inspired by the classic game played in Sinhala and Tamil New Year festivals where you'll need to guess the elephant's eye.

### How to play
* When you click 'play', a countdown will begin, and the elephant will begin to move.
* Once the countdown is over, the elephant will be hidden, but it will continue to move around the game area.

* Depending on how close to the eye you click, you'll get a score.
* Try to score as high as possible and beat your friends!
* Good luck! Have fun!
